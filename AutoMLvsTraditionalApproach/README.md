## Comparison of AutoML and traditional Machine Learning methods
This project demonstrates advanced skills in classifying data using both traditional methods and modern AutoML tools.
Team members: Agata Kopyt, Zuzanna Kotli≈Ñska.

### Project Description
The aim of the project was to develop a classification method enabling the construction of a highly predictive model on a artificially generated dataset. The dataset consisted of 500 explanatory variables, some of which were significant for classification into two classes. The classification process was conducted in two variants: manual and using AutoML frameworks, with the accuracy of the models assessed using balanced accuracy.

### Scope of Work
**Data Preparation:**
- Analysis and preparation of a training set consisting of 2000 observations.
- Utilization of labels from the training set for model training.
- Preparation of a test set consisting of 600 observations for evaluating prediction quality.

**Manually Created Model:**
- Selection and fine-tuning of a classification model.
- Conducting experiments to optimize hyperparameters.
- Evaluation of the model on the test set using balanced accuracy.

**AutoML Model:**
- Utilization of advanced AutoML tools for automatically selecting the best model and its hyperparameters.
- Comparison of results with the manually created model.

**Documentation and Presentation:**
- Development of a detailed report containing methodology and experiment results.
- Preparation of a presentation summarizing key project achievements.

### Achievements
- **Model Effectiveness:** Both the manual and AutoML models achieved high balanced accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the ability to effectively classify data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Careful optimization of hyperparameters for the manual model, leading to improved classification results.
